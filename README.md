# Devops-Course-FALL-2024
This repository contains a detailed walkthrough of the concepts and technologies I learned during the DevOps Course FALL-2024, taught by @Saim Safdar.

## What I Have Learned
Throughout this course, I gained hands-on experience with various DevOps tools and practices, including:

* Version Control: GitHub
* Containerization: Docker, Podman
* Orchestration: Kubernetes, Istio
* Cloud Services: ECS/EKS
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
* Terraform
* Pulumi
* Policy as Code: Kyverno
* Serverless Frameworks: Knative
* Networking: Ingress

**Docker vs. Virtual Machines (VMs): A Comparison**  

Docker and Virtual Machines (VMs) both create isolated environments for applications but differ in functionality and use cases.  

- **Performance**: Docker containers are lightweight and start in seconds by sharing the host system‚Äôs kernel. VMs, which boot entire operating systems, take minutes to start.  
- **Use Cases**: Docker is ideal for microservices and rapid deployment. VMs are better for complete isolation and running multiple OSs, especially for legacy applications.  
- **Popularity**: Docker is highly demanded in cloud computing and DevOps for its speed and consistency, while VMs remain essential in enterprise settings for secure, multi-OS environments.  
- **Simplicity**: Docker is simpler to use, offering pre-made images and easy replication. VMs require more setup and expertise to install full OSs.  
- **User Experience**: Docker ensures consistent environments across machines. VMs provide a traditional desktop-like experience but are slower.  
- **Resource Requirements**: Docker is resource-efficient, supporting many containers on one machine. VMs are resource-intensive, limiting the number of instances.  

**Conclusion**:  
Docker is suited for scenarios requiring rapid deployment, scalability, and resource efficiency, while VMs are better for projects needing full isolation and OS environments. The choice depends on project needs.

**Pulumi vs. Terraform: A Quick Comparison**  

Both Pulumi and Terraform let you set up cloud resources (like servers and databases) using code instead of doing it manually.  

### **Key Differences**  
- **Language**:  
  - **Terraform**: Uses its own language (HCL).  
  - **Pulumi**: Lets you use Python, JavaScript, or other familiar languages.  

- **Ease of Testing**:  
  - **Pulumi**: Works with regular programming tests.  
  - **Terraform**: Needs special testing tools.  

- **Storage**:  
  - **Terraform**: Saves setup info on your computer (or files you configure).  
  - **Pulumi**: Stores it in the cloud.  

- **Secrets Management**: Pulumi handles passwords and sensitive info more easily.  

- **Reusing Code**:  
  - **Terraform**: Uses "modules."  
  - **Pulumi**: Reuses code like regular programming projects.  

### **When to Use Each**  
- **Terraform**:  
  - You don‚Äôt mind learning a new, simple language.  
  - You want lots of online examples and a big community.  

- **Pulumi**:  
  - You know Python, JavaScript, or similar languages.  
  - You prefer treating cloud setup like regular programming.  

### **Bottom Line**  
- **Terraform**: The well-established tool with lots of support.  
- **Pulumi**: The modern option that works like your usual programming.
